<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Yanique Ewen i am a Fullstack web developer. im fluent in HTM,CSS,Javascript,swift,SQL and Databases,React,Node,Web Design,
  Web3 and Bockchain.
  I entered the world of web development after 4 years of working as a Licenced Massage Therapist. After Realizing 
   that my true passion is working with computers and while i was one of the very best in my career i was not truly 
   happy being a therapist.
  I've tried many things including atempting an enlistment in the army but fell short. Ultimately i knew i was going to
  end up sitting in front of a computer for living some day but i just didnt knpow what exactly i wante dto do with computers.
</p>

<p>I researched and found Web Development fasinating! I coudnt choose between Web Development and Software Development so
  i chose them both! I have an Associate's Degree in Computer Science, Web Development and Software Development.
  I make beautifull websites,web apps and softwares.

<p>I was top in the feild of massage therapy and i plan on domination the world of developers as well. I strive off passion and 
  dedecation which means everything i do i give it everything i have. So wheather you have small or large business you will
  need a website or an app and you've come to the right place!
